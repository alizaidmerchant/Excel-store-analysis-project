# Excel-store-analysis-project

This project involved analyzing store sales data using Excel. I performed extensive data cleaning and transformation to ensure accuracy and consistency. Utilizing PivotTables and PivotCharts, I built a dynamic dashboard that provides key insights into sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior. Additionally, I employed formulas like IF statements to create conditional analyses, enhancing the decision-making process. The final dashboard offers a comprehensive view of the storeâ€™s sales data, enabling data-driven strategies.
